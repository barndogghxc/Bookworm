## Bookworm Proposal  
	"We need to make books cool again. If you go home with somebody,
	and they dont have books don't have sex with them" - John Waters
	Bookworm is my attempt at making a simple social media matching application like tinder for bookworms. 
	Sign up/Login through Facebook.
	Manage User profile and set discovery preferences.
	Swipe to Like/Dislike a profile.
	Real Time Chat.
	Push notifications.
	Geopositioning/GeoTagging.
	A Match Making Algorithm.
