# Bookworm

## Bookworm Proposal  
	"We need to make books cool again. If you go home with somebody and they dont have books, don't have sex with them" John Waters
	Bookworm is my attempt at making a simple social media matching application like tinder for bookworms. 
	A user will theoretically be able to sign in and or sign up. Upload a picture(s) of themselves and their currently reading book and their favorite books.
	Once there they will be able to view other users pictures/list of books and swipe left or right. If you happen to match with a user you can start up a messaging conversation.
